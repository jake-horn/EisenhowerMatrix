This was made as a practice with Javascript, plenty of online resources went towards a simple to-do list in order to understand how to manipulate the DOM and use Javascript as a beginner. I've always liked using the Einsenhower Matrix idea when I've needed to be organised and have a lot to get through, so this felt like a natural little project to get me up and running. 

Using HTML, CSS and Javascript it is a simple add to a list, remove from a list style website.
